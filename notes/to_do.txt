To Do
- create feature to log into agol and get token
- use agol token to access feature layers not published publically
- buffer 0 after downloading source layer
- have hazards be in their own tables, then join just the designated columns to the final publishing table
- have yamal data instead of paths sent to classes
- ensure tables have most efficient data types
- change wildfire theshold
- clean up log

New Features:
- Validate configuration and settings files
- clean logging
- change climate to natural

Bugs:
- bug: slightly more features are in the publish table vs the intersections table

Priority:
- Utilize output folder
